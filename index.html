    <p id="description">
        A single-player Chess game with a twist of luck

        <h2 id="rules_header">Game Rules:</h2>
        <p id="rules">
            Legal moves are exactly like classic Chess (except: no castling)
            <br> The goal is to gain points by capturing black pieces
            <br> captures are possible only with the same piece type
            <br> (for example: a black-king can be captured only by a white-king)
            <br>
            <br> Blocks are added randomly according to difficulty
            <br> Try to survive as long as possible before the blocks destroy all your pieces
            <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="tip"> tip:
        <br> Extra points are given for captures in a row,
        <br> and for clearing all the blocks from the board</h3>
